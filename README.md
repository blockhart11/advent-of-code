A place to solve festive coding challenges!

# Disclaimer
The code in this repository is ugly, non-idiomatic, and lacking in professionalism and (useful) documentation. I am fully aware of its flaws, but this challenge is about fun, experimentation, and problem solving, and hey, if it runs it ships!

Please don't judge me.
